                <strong>SOLID</strong>. Sounds good right? It sounds like a goal worth achieving; 
                like something to strive for. It also sounds like something that can be measured, 
                and if it can be measured, then there must be a formula one can apply to achieve it. 
                I think that’s what Michael Feathers had in mind when he coined the acronym to help 
                us remember the first five object-oriented principles of class design, collected and 
                published by Robert C. Martin<sup>1</sup>.

                At the core, these principles offer flexibility and maintainability. They help us write 
                code that is easier to understand, at a micro-level.&nbsp; Grasping a macro-understanding, 
                a more wholesome view of our code, can become a challenge. We’ll introduce some practices, 
                that should help you achieve that later.
