<blockquote>
    Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of 
    a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test 
    case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code 
    to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who 
    is credited with having developed or 'rediscovered' the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD 
    encourages simple designs and inspires confidence<sup>1</sup>.
