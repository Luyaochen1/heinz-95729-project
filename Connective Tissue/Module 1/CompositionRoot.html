            A Composition Root is a (preferably) unique location in an application where modules are composed together.

        <p>
            Our project is made up of two apps: the client and the server. We have a Composition 
            Root for each app. Both of these Composition Roots are defined in the same project: 
            the web project, <em>Moviq</em>. The client Composition Root can be found in 
            the <em>js</em> folder and is named, <em>compositionRoot.js</em>. The server 
            Composition Root is in the <em>App_Start</em> folder and is named, 
            <em>NancyBootstrapper.cs</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            These files present a single place for each app where we can compose the object graphs.
            What does that mean? The Composition Root, is the place where we will satisfy the 
            dependencies that one object may have on another. It is a single, easy to find location 
            in our app, where we can redefine these dependencies as/if they change in the future.
