            Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed 
            for modification.

            The original definition is a bit abstract, but the meaning is rather simple. In the 
            same way that we use scope to clearly communicate and define responsibility, we can 
            also design our code such that it rarely needs to change.

            Pay special attention to Solution 2, in this reading, as it is the solution we will 
            use in this course. The author notes that OCP complements SRP. When you move on to 
            Interface Segregation, you will find even more complimentory methodology is at play 
            in the SOLID principles.

            Ignore the authors rant about interface naming conventions. No one is familiar with all
            IDE's and color schemes that developers may choose. In fact, Visual Studio with the 
            monokai theme, which I use, does not have different colors between interfaces and classes. 
            We will use the <code>I[Name]</code> convention for naming our interfaces in this course.
            Besides, we can have fun with the "I", like with the <code>IHelpCategorizeNoSqlData</code>
            interface in our project.
