        <p>
            In the <em>NancyBootstrapper.cs</em>, there are two scopes: application scope 
            (<code>ConfigureApplicationContainer</code>) and request (<code>ConfigureRequestContainer</code>)
            scope. The application scope is executed once per app start. The request scope is executed 
            once per request, and gives us a place to inject request specific dependencies, such as 
            a user's locale and authorization/security.

            The <em>compositionRoot.js</em> is loaded once per page load. Since our app is a Single 
            Page Application (SPA), that means it may be loaded only once per session. We have to 
            account for the fact that the user may refresh the page at any time, though.
