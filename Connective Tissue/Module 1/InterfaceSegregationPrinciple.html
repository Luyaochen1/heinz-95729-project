            Interface Segregation is a refinement of the Single Responsiblity principle. We
            should strive to scope our interfaces such that a caller need only implement 
            the interfaces it needs to perform a unit of work (UOW). It is also a refinement 
            of the Open-Closed principle in that our interface design should avoid the need 
            to change.
