            In industry, you will also hear the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) referred 
            to as, or in the context of <em>Dependency Injection</em> and <em>Inversion of Control</em>.

            Loose coupling is desirable, whether we are writing small consumer apps, large
            enterprise apps, middle-ware or third-party toolsets. Loose coupling can be the 
            difference between an organizations ability to maintain and improve their 
            offering(s) or failing to keep pace with the market due to rigidity and lack of 
            flexibility. It can (and should) be a deciding factor in client adoption.
