            Child classes should never break the parent class' type definitions.

        <p>
            The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) purposes that derived classes 
            should not modify the behavior of the classes/interfaces from which they 
            are derived, such that the base class'/interface's output is free of tacit knowledge. 
            In other words, the scope of responsibility of a given method is always the 
            same, and may not be changed by derived (child) classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll get to SOLID Part 3 in the next reading. We'll also review another example 
            of breaking LSP when we start to review the code for our project.
