            The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) has a lot in common with Separation of Concerns. The key 
            differentiator is that the Single Responsibility Principle is focused on class design, where 
            Separation of Concerns is a broader concept that we apply in micro and macro design. The Single 
            Responsibility Principle is a focused refinement of Separation of Concerns.

            I can't talk about SRP without talking about scope. "What is the scope of responsibility 
            for the class I am about to write"? We talk about scope in project management, so often, 
            some of the answer to that question is already answered at the time the developer starts 
            to write code. It also helps to envision what a telescope does: it reduces our point of 
            view to a single, focused object.

            After reading this article, you should be able to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Break a problem into concerns/functionality grouped by category and behavior</li>
            <li>Clearly communicate the responsibility of classes and methods through naming conventions</li>
        </ul>
